## About this project:
In this project, I learned and practiced:
- How to manipulate JSON data
- How to use request_title.js): JavaScript script that uses the
  Star Wars API to print the title of the Star Wars movie with a given integer episode
  number.
  * Usage: `./3-starwars_title.js <3-starwars_title.js>`.

  * [4-starwars_count.js](./4-starwars_count.js): JavaScript script that uses the
  Star Wars API to print the number of movies featuring the character "Wedge Antilles".
  * Usage: `./4-starwars_count.js http://swapi.co/api/films/`.

  * [5-request_store.js](./5-request_store.js): JavaScript script that stores the
  contents of a webpage in a file.
  * Usage: `./5-request_store.js <URL to get> <file path to store content in>`.

  * [6-completed_tasks.js](./6-completed_tasks.js): JavaScript script that uses the
  JSONPlaceholder API to compute the number of tasks completed per user ID.
  * Usage: `./6-completed_tasks.js https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`.

  * [100-starwars_characters.js](./100-starwars_characters.js): JavaScript script
  that uses the Star Wars API to print all characters featured in a given movie.
  * Usage: `./100-starwars_characters.js <movie ID>`.

  * [101-starwars_characters.js](./101-starwars_characters.js): JavaScript script
  that uses the Star Wars API to print all characters featured in a given movie in
  the same order as they are listed in the `characters` list of the `/films/` response.
